        <p>
          Basic access is free. VIP access is currently offered at ₹99 for the access period shown
          before payment and includes the features displayed on the Membership &amp; Plans page. Prices
          are in Indian rupees and include applicable taxes unless stated otherwise. Any price or
          billing frequency and applicable taxes will be clearly presented before you authorise payment.

          Payments are processed through a third-party payment gateway (such as Stripe, PayU, PayPal
          or another disclosed payment provider). We do not
          receive or store your complete card, UPI or banking credentials. Your payment may also be

          exceed the amount you paid Tryren in the three months before the event giving rise to the claim.
